## Readme
A hugo-built static website acting as a digitized "notebook" to document and interact with the things I learn. Also a melting pot of possibly useless facts and hobbies for ample distraction from purely educational content.

# Goal
* To make what I've learned accessible and editable from anywhere. 
* To not forget, because remembering isn't necessary with a lookup table.
* To explore topics that deeply interest me.

# Status
* Web server location 127.0.0.1

# Built With
* Hugo - static website framework

# Acknowledgements
* GitHub user vividvilla - [hugo theme template](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil)
* Master cp Austin Traver - for [inspiration](https://helpful.wiki/) and all the help
